              Evidently, young Canadians felt that Sex-Ed classes provided them
              with an abundance of scientific information but was

               Currently, Sex-Ed is leaving youth without the practical
              knowledge that would help them navigate their sexual lives.
              Respondents noted the lack of explicit instruction on safe sexual
              practices that would reduce the chances of getting

              Overwhelmingly, young Canadians had scathing reviews of their
              Sex-Ed experience. The most common topics they wish they had been
              taught were Gender & Sexual Identity, Consent & Relationships,
              Pleasure, Female Sexual Health, and the pros & cons of Porn.

              shocking statistic, it is clear that youth are more susceptible to
